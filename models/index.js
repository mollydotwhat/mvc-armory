// const User = require('./User');
// think I need to fix fields in User model, because of how one-to-many works.

// User hasMany(character), character belongsTo(user)

// items & characters are belongsToMany, using a through table written in sequelize.define statement. Statement can take objects, which will reference the models & keys.



// module.exports = { User, Character, Item }
